# Deepfake Video Detection ðŸŽ­

This is a web-based application for detecting deepfake videos using **Flask** and **PyTorch**.  
Users can upload a video, and the system predicts whether itâ€™s **REAL** or **FAKE**.

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works
1. **Upload Video** â†’ User uploads a video through the web interface.  
2. **Preprocessing** â†’ Frames are extracted with OpenCV, faces are detected & cropped, resized, and normalized.  
3. **Feature Extraction** â†’ Each frame is passed through a pre-trained **ResNeXt50 CNN** to extract spatial features.  
4. **Sequence Learning** â†’ Features are fed into an **LSTM** to capture temporal patterns across frames.  
5. **Classification** â†’ The model outputs a probability for REAL or FAKE.  
6. **Result Display** â†’ Flask shows the prediction and confidence score in the web UI.  

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack
- **Flask** (Web Framework)  
- **PyTorch** (Model Training & Inference)  
- **OpenCV** (Video Processing)  
- **face_recognition** (Face Detection)
